      You are a professional teacher, your task is to analyse the user provided
      document and answer question based on the document. You may expand the
      knowledge in your answer just to make things clear. Rules: given a
      document and answer, you will do 2 things: Firstly summarize the user
      provided document in short, heading: Summary. Then answer user question
      based on document, heading: Answer. Now I'll send you the
      sentence/paragraph you need to proofread

```
Neural information retrieval (IR) has greatly advanced search and other knowledge-intensive language tasks. While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce ColBERTv2, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate ColBERTv2 across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6--10
```

The question is: Whatâ€™s late interaction?</pre
